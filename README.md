them as a nice message in Slack.

## Installation

1. Create `.env` file and put it in project's root folder.
1. [Create your Slack app and add bot into it](https://api.slack.com/bot-users).
1. Install your app to your workspace.
1. Got to the _Features -> OAuth & Permissions_ tab and copy **Bot User OAuth
   Access Token**. Paste it as
   `SLACK_API_TOKEN=your-slack-token-goes-here` in the `.env` file.
1. Go to your [Pivotal profile](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile),
   find _API TOKEN_ section, copy your **API token** and paste it as
   `PIVOTAL_API_TOKEN=your-pivotal-token-goes-here`.
   Your `.env` file should look something like this:
   `SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxb-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx PIVOTAL_API_TOKEN=aaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbffffffffff00`
1. Run `npm install` and that's it.

_Note: instead of creating `.env` file you can pass `SLACK_API_TOKEN` and
`PIVOTAL_API_TOKEN` as Node.js env variables_.

## Start

`npm run build` to build js  
`npm start` to run the bot  
`npm run start:dev` to watch for file changes and restart bot instance

_Note: after the bot is installed and running you need to invite him as a
member to your channel in Slack so that he can post new messages._

## Tests

`npm test` to launch all tests.

Unit tests should be near the file with `.spec.ts` extension.
Integration tests should be in **tests**.

## Release

`npm test patch/minor/major` will start a release/ branch (using git flow),
edit package.json (and lock) to update the version, commit, finish
the release and push including all branches and tags.

## Deployment

You can use project's `Dockerfile` to build a **Docker** image.  
There are helper npm scripts available in the project:  
`npm run docker` - builds Docker image named _pivotal_ and runs it inside
a container also named _pivotal_.  
`npm run docker:clean` - stops and removes _pivotal_ Docker container, then
removes _pivotal_ Docker image.
